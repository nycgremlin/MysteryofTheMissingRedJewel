    <p>Something about the twinkle in Zabel’s eye convinces you to go to Frankenbeet’s bank. As you drive up, you realize that the Old Man has a private bank which is heavily guarded. The car gets stopped before you even pass the front gates and the guards have a talk with you. They appear to be taking orders from a nasally voice booming over their radios. It screams an order to not let you in without a warrant and the guards repeat the order back to you. The guards seemed like agreeable men so you decide to chat them up for any info about the Old Man. The guards say the Old Man might seem rude, but he’s never treated them badly. They reminisce about getting heavy bonuses during the holidays, although lately the Old Man had been cutting these bonuses short. Jimbo and Zabel look defeated and start to head back to the car. You thank the men for their time and head back as well. </p>
